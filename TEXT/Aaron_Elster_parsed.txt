R. O. N. last name is E. L. S. T. E. R. and what was your name at birth my Jewish name was not from one arm which is I dropped enough men and I am using the error and which is which is what I'm using and is that the name you were known buys a chance and when were you born I was born February fourth nineteen thirty three however I'm not sure whether that's exactly the date I was born that's the date I've been using ever since I came to the United States Hey I could be a year older year older perhaps not younger and how old are you now %HESITATION based on February fourth nineteen thirty three am sixty two I could be sixty two or sixty three and where were you born I was born in a town called so cove Pulaski circle for spelled S. O. okay O. L. O. W. they %HESITATION has a little slash on that than the L. has a selection so soft elves focal %HESITATION Pulaski is PO de L. A. S. K. I. circle Lasky in the country Poland %HESITATION next size town was a town called shed let's Bancroft those with the towns around us family by probably eighty ninety miles the war so and could you tell us about your town in the are the town a to the best of my recollection had a population of approximately twelve thousand people %HESITATION by the beginning of the war by nineteen thirty nine %HESITATION there were probably between four to five thousand Jews in that town all the town with one to get %HESITATION started there were approximately six thousand Jews in that town because they changed all the Jews out of the farm areas and in the vicinities named bottom alt into the town so therefore the probably where about six thousand Jews and what kind of town was this was this and cultural town urban kind of place Tom was surrounded with farms on but %HESITATION the town itself but the Jewish population there are a lot of trades Taylor's shoemakers %HESITATION store owners %HESITATION I remember there were a couple of schools those two schools there was also a at three synagogues that I remember all there was a a shiver that I recall and what is the issue shiver as a %HESITATION so I would imagine it would become a server binnacle preparation for the event occurred before the binnacle %HESITATION in town for my recollection was if the Jews are fairly religious dental and most of them were friendly religions the normal things as a child I remember it's just my surrounding areas a later on by thirty nine of forty I remember there was a movie houses we still didn't have inside %HESITATION plumbing %HESITATION but that was part of our life and never knew that anything else existed so we didn't feel like we were deprived of anything I would say my childhood was fairly normal being based on those surroundings and circumstances what was it like %HESITATION but as a child do it five six seven years of age I want the fader which is Hebrew school I never had a chance to Hebrew school auto educator hater well it's haters he posted at cellular on out of our how to train here how to read he wrote and we had a %HESITATION a teacher no but I do remember a teacher we used to call it I think was called him a lot and so the traditional laws you sat around the table and you repeated what he said you read from a book and if you didn't go well he would take his barn on give you on over the head but that was common to that happened it happened to me I got thrown out of favor one time effect but he was my uncle with a big long red beard he lived up stairs of us and the the fan I was right in his apartment %HESITATION recollect that and never went to public school because my time I was old enough to go to public school on the war was on and I we as Jews we couldn't go to public school so my education just prior to the war was limited to religious education of my formal education really didn't start to love the warm what was your family like my family had a butcher shop my dad and my mother both worked in the butcher shop in fact all it was sort of unusual but my family's shop was the clientele was mostly gentile because our meats were not kosher means it was not for Jewish consumption so most of our customers where either the farmers four of the polls %HESITATION in in within the city and therefore while our Clinton's is where a lot of wear Polish people and that's probably one of the reasons for my and my sister survival because of our quinces with the gentle population apart from your butcher shop business were you associated with gentiles at your age of the child %HESITATION personally %HESITATION I don't even know whether they were gentle Jews over kids that we've played with but I do recall the ventilation of a gentile black you know coming up to me and asked me why I killed Christ and at that time I didn't know Christ was so I went home and asked my parents %HESITATION Christ as a why is he saying that %HESITATION %HESITATION that was probably my first encounter with that type of situation but the I live basically in the Jewish community so we were pretty well confined to our area we did mingle with the outside community we were aware of anti semitism and not at that age not till basically when the war started to about nineteen thirty nine non that's when I became more aware of what I was more aware of a lot of feelings and with of religious cult conflicts that I had as a child and %HESITATION that started very young with me and %HESITATION I'm I'm very surprised at that I was supposedly very skinny and my mother used to want to fatten me up so she would slips take me in the backyard and slip some non kosher meets but then I would have nightmares that I will be going to hell that I would be because I a train if an entertainer you learned that if you committed any type of sense that there was a letter to go up to heaven in anytime you committed to send one of the wrongs would be gone and you'd never make it up to heaven and I think I must move five six years old and I was already preoccupied with death and in heaven and hell my god was a very eventful ventral god that's my recollection all were your parents religious my dad was my mother wasn't she came from a family of twelve children and %HESITATION more boisterous time vality my dad was sort of on the quiet side sedate %HESITATION he came I think from a more religious family factor his father I was named after his dad my sister was named after his mother my grandfather's name was not one hour nine ibid naturally I never knew him so there was a somewhat of a conflict I think in them ideology and from what I understand as a kid I think was also fixed marriage because %HESITATION she was more the aggressive type in the outgoing and he was the opposite so I think it was the marriage was sort of fixed so out of the butcher shop come about to be a non kosher Patricia %HESITATION that I don't know that I don't know why I would imagine was a business decision was less competition in the area and perhaps they felt that this was the best way to make a living hi my don't know there's a lot of kosher butcher shops in fact my grandfather was a butcher and so my uncles and butcher shop but the level of my my mother's sister and I had an aunt I haven't I I had an amp I she also had a petition so I don't know how that came about public from not for business reasons but I don't remember going into the butcher shop all the time effect caring meets all delivering seeing people come on the drudge keeps on them horse drawn wagons park in front of the store and then I also remember the %HESITATION %HESITATION that would that start happening in nineteen thirty nine also where %HESITATION polls would comment though paste stickers on the customers back with a sign saying chignon freeing %HESITATION Polish being paying for buying from Joe's okay and then on the other hand the religious people didn't like us having train me so there was always a conflict I don't know how it got started but I just happen to remember that you mentioned that there was a conflict with that but the home life I think was fairly normal I didn't have any wants or needs for anything %HESITATION I had uncles that used to make twice for me I'd be I'd gladly give them my food and %HESITATION they would trade me for for toys in fact I remember one thing one uncle of mine is to make it so out of roof shingles used to make like a rifle with a rubber band and you would put a piece of what on then you could shoot I thought it was quite quite nice all in one was there close later that wasn't probably thirty nine one just about when the war started fact I remember when the war started the bombs the Germans attacked and the bombs came down I was okay there we all were not afraid of it into the woods that was my first experience with that and my parents also ran out and we were laying in the wooded area and the bombs were falling in the airplane is they seem so tremendous the noise was so powerful first encounter I've ever seen on a plan of the sun outlet effective some very few cars because mostly everything was forced or somebody %HESITATION some my realization of thing began after the after the war started that's where my memory is did you know what was happening when the banks were coming I began to realize what was happening I would say closer to nineteen forty there were a lot of Jews they were thrown out of Germany so some Jews came to different parts of Poland and I remember there was one German Jew that lived in the back of our house and at night the neighbors used to get together and they used to come into the house and they used to talk about all the noble things that was going to be for all the Jews and that was already happening to choose one as a child I used to sit in the corner listen to all this conversation and absorb it all and be very very frightened because they were predicting terrible things never going to happen to to to the germs and mostly from people from the outside what were they saying what's happening in Germany well number one the rich chasing the Jews out of Germany that we're putting the concentration camps they were building catalogs %HESITATION those type of things and then later around the room a stock coming round about killing of Jews our people didn't believe Japan's somewhat then somewhat not because nobody would believe that this type of Holocaust was going to happen that that type of wholesale slaughter could possibly happen Jews in Europe were used to programs and %HESITATION anti semitism and the and from time to time %HESITATION a program to happen that %HESITATION somebody was killed all people are hurt or their stores were damaged but not the not to the extent of the that was going on %HESITATION had there been programs in your childhood my childhood but they didn't really touch me I was not I wasn't touched by the did you know when most of the stories that I heard from my parents and from family and from from neighbors did you have brothers and sisters reticence I have %HESITATION one sister that's slightly older than I am and I have a younger sister that was about two years younger than me she died in Treblinka and I was only the most famous and naturally my parents my father's name was hi am stroll and my mother's name was Sylvia as I indicated she came from a family of twelve children this tournament are still survive one lives in New York his name is Sam sharp and does one in Israel the name of school sharp it was another one by name of Monica goals Goldstine she's now the seas they escape to Russia in nineteen thirty nine when the Russians were retreating and the Germans and the Russians and the Russians were at this same and they went down the same time in our town %HESITATION when they were retreating a lot of the lot of Jews quite a few Jews escape to Russia because they anticipated what was going to happen but a lot of people didn't believe it especially people had businesses Matt homes and they just didn't feel that they should be leaving them and my parents apparently decided to stay so after the bombing at the end of nineteen thirty %HESITATION nineteen thirty nine no our business still continued a slightly slowly things start happening Jews have to start wearing armbands and the other %HESITATION rations to to start with and then the people were gathered from the outskirts of the city and bought into the town a certain part of the town was allocated towards again I'll and then about nineteen forty they start to put walls around again %HESITATION at the main entrance is on the streets and on and to feel some of barbed wire with guys walking around what are you aware of all the players I was so I was extremely mature %HESITATION I don't know why it at a very young age and I'll I'll touch on it in the in the second I just wanted to tell you about the the commerce that was going on while the get out while in together and I remember they used to smuggle beef head to the barbed wire by cutting the fences now members a kid number two three people they will slaughter calling a barn and all of a sudden that was made for people %HESITATION we had a we had food in it to eat during those times I never felt any anti I didn't feel any problems but I do know people walking around begging I see people sitting around not having anything to eat but somehow my parents were able to manage during those times to provide food and shelter phones what did you think was going on but it seemed like I was frightened of what was going on because of what I was hearing all I was frightened that %HESITATION I believe that they were going to kill the Jews and tell the stores were coming around at the park concentration camps that were crematoriums that they were burning just a killing Jews putting in the mass graves and so on and that fight me very much in fact are you still I used to say to god though you know why hi it could have been more than maybe seven eight years of age why and I always wanted to be spared and I tried to might make deals in my own way with god to spare me but yet after I would do all that I would say to myself why would god want to spare you after all the %HESITATION more children that are much more pious than you so why would he spell you so that was sort of a conflict wanting to live in yet having feelings the why will what god make an exception and let me survive and that's never escape me it's been with me ever since I was in a small kid kind of deals we do try to make because well that I was going to be a good person was going to do a good dance and the normal type of promises that your promise when you want something but yet the some of the reason I would always fight that in my own cell because I didn't feel I was white warning out let's say why would he do that did you to quickly try to pick I thought I always that except for the times when somebody is to feed me some trifle with food which I wasn't supposed to eat after all what kind of troubles could I possibly get into it seven years of age or ideas of it when the hand are dead whatever I'm supposed to do %HESITATION but we start seeing that %HESITATION things happening within the ghetto and I remember that C. Treblinka death camp Treblinka was only about seventeen to twenty miles away from my town and they formed a committee there was a a committee within the ghetto president of police there was a whole government and all the Germans will demand a certain number of people to go to Treblinka to help build a camp so help expand on the campus Custer blink existed as a labor camp before and nobody ever came back and I also remember my dad being on the list to go to Treblinka result for for labor purposes but like anything else he was able to you can always somehow he made a deal to to to get out of that get off that list when that was probably nineteen forty one how did you know at that time what Treblinka was what has become guess it became a very very cheerful murmurs numbers nobody came back from Treblinka was all rooms and your family please Valya plant but nobody believed the extent of it nobody believed extend people walking through that that's what we believe that it was going to happen something was going to interfere somebody was going to save them and I remember %HESITATION in to get on the my sister used to be that the %HESITATION Currier she is to deliver the meets the outsides snake through the gates your elders smile the system and it was easier for her to do because as a child as a young girl if you don't look Jewish nobody bothered you but as a boy was much more difficult because of the circumcision all they have to do is take your pants down they know you were Jewish present Paul and nobody was circumcised in those years so she was more involved with the business and then I what helping out but I also remember the black market and %HESITATION the gendarmes is to come in and the two in the ghetto and there was one guy the name alone back they will forget him he was a up %HESITATION a Polish national %HESITATION lived on the German border they were coldly full extension and he was in the gendarmes one day came to the house track my dad out of the bed about two three in the morning and in the whole way they used to have like a two by four two two two two guards doors and it took that to buy for proceeded to beat my dad with a focus on why because he didn't pay off somebody squealed out and that I do on them member my dad walking around with the with the sling on him and I felt I felt I felt terrible for my dad I'm always felt extreme compassion for my father he represented something very soft and very idealistic and so on not so my mother my mother was more the question when chevron so %HESITATION solicitation relationship and always saw all these years I still picture him the same way I remember one time we had to have a tooth pulled it was no such thing as Nova Kaine or whatever so he didn't go to shop that day and I remember I came home and took a bottle of liquor and started drinking at and I would help him and then he made silly thing and made a bunch of fight aches with both eight and then the that's the day I had with him which I I I cherish for a long time how about that was probably forty one also I mean in all there are bad things happening but my family for some odd reason was able to stay together the what happened down in nineteen forty two oh one together was totally closed are you noticed the %HESITATION the harsher things that were happening people being pulled out people being shot if a German walked on the sidewalk you better get off the sidewalk because they had welcomed could canyon there was no law that says that they could and it was tougher to operate the star that and I used to see people sitting on the streets begging to for food and also in Nancy a and some of and it didn't touch me that much but I was your family involved with the administration of not on anymore but apparently they must've known people in the administration because otherwise they couldn't possibly function in the business of us all you know one day on business next day or not but they function hand them now nineteen forty two as I said things started becoming worse they were pulling people out of the ghetto sending admin transports but the farmers had the right to they had the right to elect ghetto people to work on the farms those were the large farmers there were connected to the German government and my mom and dad and my sister and myself and maybe thirty other families where chosen by this particular farmer to work on his farm now that fire was a whole village that he owned it goes back to the five times that type of thing can you paint him because you're out of the ghetto and that happened just before the Jewish holidays probably in June of forty two and we were there for a couple of months we lived in one big barn and my parents would go on the field to work what did you do hunger wrong no just hung around a thinker is to go with them hang around the bar and hang around doing nonsense things but then came the Jewish holidays nineteen forty two about what pressure on us that that's the Russian it comes out in September I believe andam por comes out either the end of September or October and everybody wants to go home for the holidays my mother expected that bad things are happening she made a deal with a Polish woman to take my sister and Haidar which since I read it to her tuition and my older sister so they left on a farm myself my mom and dad and my younger sister came back for the holidays for Russia China and then camper and tell the day of atonement the day after the morning after the day of atonement together was invaded by the SS and Ukrainians Ukrainian soldiers and they started the liquidation remember my mother waking me up and telling me to get dressed in a hurry we have to go on a hiding place because they were killing Jews and never liquidating together in our building there was a double wall on the second floor it's like a a room that was hidden from site and you can only go into the attic could so all of us including our neighbors ran into that hiding place into the big room the probably where about thirty to forty people men women children and infants and that day and that my ability here we're shooting and screaming and stuff in back of our yard there was a in back of the house there was a %HESITATION %HESITATION of a field and they dug a big wave and they would March the people down there and shoot some of the people some were marched to the train to go to Treblinka I don't know what reason the line was useful we were in that hiding place and %HESITATION guess my first encounter with death was in the hiding place children started to cry and the adults were telling the mothers to stifle their children and if they didn't stifle him Saiful them we would all be found out and does a woman sitting next to me with a small child maybe two people away that quiet at her child by by choking vice mother child and tell twenty so were found out anyway never shooting into the hiding place and they opened up to opening to be hiding place and you're gonna house you know and we all wear what is you opinion laws Jews out and we're all heard it out into the street against the building and my mother was separated from us my dad and I and my little sister where marched against that wall while the rest of the people were being brought out
