%HESITATION that we were taken there were some huge trees that had thousands and thousands of smaller repairs in what used to bring a moment burlap sacks and let him they are very right in when they were right almost to a point they were almost there are spoiled we put him in a hot oven in day %HESITATION became like we can by now fruit that has been %HESITATION dry fruit thing we could preserve

our home we had beautiful garden topsoil over there was very rich Serra member it we had %HESITATION like onions potatoes string beans carrots we had all those but of course they were seasonal they would just in the summertime and of course during the winter tire we we didn't have all those things there was no refrigeration or anything like no electricity anything like that ed did you work out in the garden to go absolutely I was helping in hoping my mother the terror we enjoyed it very much string beans prepare I'm so they can be cooked and got potatoes tomatoes since we had a beautiful

on wonderful mom and Daddy were the %HESITATION the main thing tire family well %HESITATION at home we were assisting but we could with the younger children and %HESITATION we as children we we were playing and everything went along beautifully and tell nineteen nineteen forty let me ask you first are yes we had for instance we had but be colder Russia call which was the the %HESITATION one who was small lance didn't charge over but assisting we had %HESITATION %HESITATION a rough in the community and we had our butcher store we had our job for instance on pace so we had about baked are on Matz's and %HESITATION the Jewish community work very nicely together in fact there was a big speaker brought bite that job was in our community as I remember it later he moved from her sipping came to a different city but there were many are many things that the Jewish people were United work very nicely together I zero where there are occasions when the Jewish and non Jewish people got together for anything that you remember don't think so we did not we live together so the neighbors and there were many are people who knew a bat is far as the remaining in people they had huge pieces of land and they were more or less of what they needed to buy and and the Jewish people had crystal small businesses for instance %HESITATION that were selling like cut sugar %HESITATION and %HESITATION but the lamps they had a it's not gasoline it's Serra kerosene and song certain items that are you could not have in those communities that had to be brought in from other parts of the country I'm going to hand the Romanian people they had corn %HESITATION we and they grow growing does things in huge areas of land the togetherness this I remember it was quite well they lived in peace and there were many people who knew all different people remaining in Jewish people but generally the Jewish people had their own synagogue occasionally %HESITATION there were some outbreaks like it all depended often times on a %HESITATION on the priest of often times in their in their churches and there weren't occasionally outbreaks of certain of like certain on friendliness bit is far as I remember it until nineteen forty things were quite quiet in there in nineteen forty our section of Romania plus section of Czechoslovakia was occupied by a Hungarian what you describe to us what you were thinking about when you said occasionally there would be outbreaks can you remember any of those times and described in to well play yes I remember some of the things if for instance very Jewish boy on the end of our non Jewish boy we're getting into our argument or fax whatever the expression was always %HESITATION remark that she'd done detail love Palestine so %HESITATION joke go to work go to Palestine this was often the remark if if there was some kind of a disagreement %HESITATION made that %HESITATION when you say everywhere are I would say the the %HESITATION he non Jewish sure boy if we wanted to get evil which he or something that was often the remark which of course was very painful bar we couldn't even if we wanted to go with the palace that we couldn't do it but %HESITATION this was the error and of course later as I grew up I've heard many instances largest cities that there were some anti semitism that was often outbreaks in some of the larger communities are let's talk a little about the public school that you went to can you tell us the %HESITATION what kinds of courses you had classes in the public school in the public schools the we were sitting %HESITATION boys were separated from girls and set the ship section same thing classroom but more less sitting in different rows we learned %HESITATION what we call a day of Romanian language the are %HESITATION Rick mythic reading writing and there are some little doubt literature about the history of Romania %HESITATION and insofar as symptoms trader which I did go also in addition to their secular school we weren't around to learning more less Hebrew and the interpretation from Hebrew to you dish and they are prayers every morning and in the evenings we went to culture to the synagogue for prayers and %HESITATION also we also learned some arithmetic in in in the %HESITATION Hebrew school also fade also boys with separate from the girls and of course we wore a cap all the time we did not go without their Kapono raids half what did you think about the public school what I liked it so effect was quite a distance from our home and I remember %HESITATION in the summertime we used to just go through their little main street to the public school and dark in the winter time %HESITATION their remaining and people were %HESITATION taking their %HESITATION funder feels there fertilizer there was so certain the %HESITATION fertilizer they had on their slants I remember quite often that %HESITATION there was struck from a cow and %HESITATION left over in their in their Barnes and we used to I used to try to get a right on those slats in the back over there and if the a man who was driving the horses didn't see it I used to get it right partially on the way to school in the winter time we was very cold and you have to wear sympathize workloads did you ever have any difficulty with the remaining children in school you know naked I remember I don't think so for looks that I remembered that at that age and stage there are wars do you remember seeing any occur around you with among the other children no I think so we were more or less so playing to the groups of children as far as playing is concerned we were more or less to get over the boys in our immediate neighborhoods in death most of the Jewish people did live are more or less than a certain section of the town there to many people lived in %HESITATION way further out and %HESITATION big fields and get a home here and there but the Jewish people lift closely together so most about playing was done with the Jewish boys with regard to you talked about praying in the morning and going to synagogue and evening to with home were you when you get this well %HESITATION thanks to go with my father often times my grandfather that I remember published quite a youngster when he died but I do remember when he died when the funeral was and he died at home in the way I was following DL when he was taken to the cemetery heart was carried and death and hell member walking behind holding a candle and people working behind I remember it's like a dream but I don't know exactly how old I was but I remember him and %HESITATION he used to take me to where two are the prior to to the synagogue and also with my father the delayed is had a separate section they they were not together with the man during the service are you talking about the mornings now it was on the phone sure about in the holidays but in the morning we often went in the morning to to our to the services while I was young we had ours our prayers in in the Fraser and Hebrew school Brittan shoppers in the holidays we did go to the bigger sinica and when did you go to hater the freighter when all my life as long as as far as I remember I think they started the fader it maybe at age four or five would begin to the Hebrew alphabet and there how to read and hard to our prayers things like that creator I always went when what part of the day was that okay when in fact we used to go to stay there and some part of the year before we went to regular secular school were burning the morning spent about an hour or so and then when we got out from our regular secular school we went back trader sometimes quite late in the afternoon how long was the secular school did you go for the money that I would say approximately eight o'clock until about two two two thirty in the afternoon three o'clock and then we stopped off at home for a better half an hour and then back to trader and and what were your evenings how are your evening spent **** remember can you tell us about that the evenings we spend of times by as we didn't have any %HESITATION radio service television or anything like that it was spent some time is by telling old stories the bundles were telling the children %HESITATION old stories from that was storytelling was a very young very nice %HESITATION time that the children were listening to their parents or relatives and things like that do you remember when you first started hearing things about the war going on case I mentioned awhile ago two until nineteen forty nineteen forty it was about term a youngster level so years old the Hungarian can carrying government came in occupied our section of Romania plus section of Czechoslovakia became hungry what you describe to us what you remember seeing and hearing well that was one of the beginning of the real love of frightening situation is that begin to happen they are in government third way I I found later it was more or less so together with German so they were there allies and I think now I understand this is how hunger Hungary was or was given a section of Romania because there were many Hungarians living in that part of the world so they were given a section by the Germans and they came in occupied as how did you hear about what hungry was involved in well this is something that of course I found out later but at that time of course %HESITATION we realized that the the Germans and then galleons were far less working at a closer view our relations and I remember when he and Garion soldiers came into March through town and they're very shortly after they came in things began to change changed very drastically was that the first that you knew about it when they came marching or had you will hear the adults talking at all as far as nooses concern in our small community it was very little I was quite young sick to to realize but there were many people you could see a group of people together someone heard something from someone and of course it could have happened long time ago of course until it from some people came from different communities telling this city in that city about Jewish people were taken out and you must remember there's nineteen forty one and in the Polish Jewish people at that time that we didn't know exactly what was happening we're already taken out from their homes and taken into a sweet no now is get close what as a child do you remember hearing anything from your parents or from any other people or children born I remember was that the Jewish people were beginning to be taken out from different countries countries that the Germany occupied Hey can I mean true are %HESITATION what we know now is to get those %HESITATION to be working or whatever they wanted to do how did you hear about this by listening to some of the models and some of our our parents were telling this is what's happening and it was very very sad and I could see in the expression of my mother and father as to their worries in there that are very very sad %HESITATION stories and of course the children felt that the long my oldest sister and brother we were very help assist to what we can do what we can not to we're going to stop the tape here
