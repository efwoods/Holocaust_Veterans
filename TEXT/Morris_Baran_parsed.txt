when you were speaking of the time that you were born or what part of Poland was it at that time and that was it south north %HESITATION she still part of Poland Mr part of Poland to a school billowed billow should then to but it was part of Poland elusive divided between the Soviet Union and Paul and then we were on the %HESITATION on the %HESITATION western part besides being involved in the break tire and the other thinks your involved with or as a young boy he used to do a lot of %HESITATION %HESITATION and %HESITATION reading and %HESITATION %HESITATION we would do we would need to have meetings %HESITATION %HESITATION that's that's about all the town was small it was not %HESITATION what kind of things did you like reading about the history %HESITATION four three %HESITATION I

terror relatives coming to your house for some holders or some family bands just where the %HESITATION and uncle leaving out of this out of the still struggles to come occasion which is %HESITATION children they all perished and we have %HESITATION family on my mother's side they would come to visit us occasion and we would go to visit them and none of them survived how often did you did you did you have permits for yes can you describe that for most for us very simple if you were called up to a tori you said you %HESITATION half Dora and after the %HESITATION services that was a little kid which taken and then a wine and this was it there and where there are lots of four other people that were invited friends or relatives special body will issue a time there was no special event the there was a a event for the %HESITATION for the caliph for the congregation how or what year was that when you were apartments for the remember if I can add it up for a lot of thirty three in nineteen thirty three so when you're finished %HESITATION the polar school what were the conditions in Poland at a time said described before things with tennis because at that time Hitler was already in the in a play in the in the power in in Germany and the %HESITATION the anti semitism of Hitler spilled over to Joe to Poland to imply there was some %HESITATION one that at least one very %HESITATION chauvinistic %HESITATION this everything body as cold and they can see the national Democrats they were cold and they had %HESITATION had was a woman at the muskie and that they used to engage in the and %HESITATION and axis %HESITATION against the against the Jewish %HESITATION calling for a boycott of Jewish businesses %HESITATION attacking a Jewish students %HESITATION attacking Jews business us what this something that your family of person the experience that I as I said before in our part of Poland because there was there was the majority of the people polled bill bill was the one that calls oddly and it was in the %HESITATION postal %HESITATION a small percentage we didn't feel the same anti semitism as it was raining throughout that it be in the western part of Poland were you all right there we think there's about this events in the paper so Lev press Davis show of course we do the papers %HESITATION were you did you hear anything on my radio at the time which was cut happening which we had no ego someone must one weighed in the hole that time but the %HESITATION papers give us enough information to know what was going that I can't do you recall exactly specifically what anything specifically that you're right in there in an article in the paper who'd read this G. students who attacked a US of this we knew there was a problem I commend the one pound of free speech should take a small town with an animal and they on a market day %HESITATION Jews were attacked and I don't know how many windows %HESITATION anybody when was the sound like some within the central Poland member the name of it I'm not sure about the location this newspaper that you were speaking with us a Polish Jewish newspaper was always used to do this yes because we had in Poland we had a a in fact we had a cultural autonomy this suspect the problem was %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION their democratic because they were not involved in %HESITATION into life we had a kilo weight would pay that used to the %HESITATION to the killer and %HESITATION and do it do it do it do it he left us alone and this is why we had our own school system and we had %HESITATION %HESITATION in different different segments of the Jewish population have their own school systems that would eventually just there was a Mizrahi which was with %HESITATION more of a %HESITATION put progressive and there was a scientist of a movement would have to Kabul to meet the others and %HESITATION the born which was a %HESITATION socialist non science organization had their own newspapers and was that daily newspaper in Polish soldiers newspaper in Polish school Nash segment so you were basically reading G. she discovers a did you have a chance to read that the Polish you get to us because %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION language should daily language was was a dish this is the Platt put paper was more moment for central Poland and the and the western part of Poland was some at a lot of disproportionate so in your town where you come from the spoken everyday spoken language was Yiddish image %HESITATION what kind of other things you said your father was doing girl a merchant and how long did he work those as a merchant how long C. say members until what time does he work because until the %HESITATION the %HESITATION %HESITATION the associates a came and %HESITATION and private enterprise ended so if we went through that one that the Soviets came what year was it in nine September thirty nine and and what happened when they came and I just wanna go back for a second and then I can do a seven I am registered to go to Israel illegally and that some of our townspeople yeah I feel on people and left the receive certificates but wait time my telling came around it will work out and I couldn't go through with my %HESITATION without plans because a group never reached never left the place where they were supposed to come from each each different house now you asked me about the weather service game at set city %HESITATION that was the end of the lives that I described to you before how did it end L. who was known for political activist sellout except for the Communist Party goldendoodle any any any books that you had you had to %HESITATION turning at a week in the library for example %HESITATION organization had a lively and %HESITATION when the %HESITATION so it's %HESITATION occupied the %HESITATION town %HESITATION we %HESITATION we moved slightly out of the %HESITATION location where we used to get together and somebody spotted and what will it later %HESITATION deported to the official listen I was I was questioned about its fortunes I I get out of it and no private initiative %HESITATION stores were closed %HESITATION the %HESITATION at the the %HESITATION organized a %HESITATION %HESITATION see set up some stores will work %HESITATION some you know essential merchandise was always %HESITATION the shortage %HESITATION delay life discuss when you went through %HESITATION yet private initiative with freedom of speech where you could move around to see if the air travel the talk to each other freely that'll end up do you remember the day when they had the Soviets entered a town I think was September first nineteen thirty nine do you remember what that was like for you personally when you show them what did you see did you see our our soldiers with we %HESITATION in in the the only morning we have the rumbling of of %HESITATION of %HESITATION tanks and the airplanes hand after a few hours the board it was only about ten ten kilometers from uptown the infantry came with horses and where we're going to be a horse and wagon and %HESITATION out not to worry and %HESITATION and this was sent to the %HESITATION once in a few days later they started buying everything we had what was left in the store so before the they even bought %HESITATION not ninety dollars in the because said this was this was a very bad %HESITATION and a you know a at the tile for some but for some it did it for the %HESITATION holidays or whatever it is not a digital effects but he told us that they had everything to and can you describe a bit more to life under the Soviets %HESITATION what we have no exit act access to news we have no newspapers except for the official newspaper if there was a radio there's one radio in the %HESITATION %HESITATION and there was called god Kong which is the guy that scored committee at which is a this is like the %HESITATION the %HESITATION mayor's office the small town and this is what you want and you put it you only have the speaker in your house so whatever whatever was transmitted was transmitted from musical %HESITATION there a yeah and %HESITATION
