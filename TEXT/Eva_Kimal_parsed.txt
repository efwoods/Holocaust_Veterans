L. and did you have any other names no okay have any nicknames know your birthday please I usually don't like to speak about that but my birthday is June nineteen nineteen thirty one and how old are you I'll be sixty five this year all around them was a fairly large city it was about sixty thousand inhabitants if I can remember correctly my mother's family was always from route them my father came from a little town a small town %HESITATION Ostroff said a strong it's I'm sorry a service was probably about an hour and a half or two hours from around the well my father are on the %HESITATION some of and I think he acquired it all with some partners after he got married to my mother I understand that but those days runs a finger all had to give a gallery %HESITATION in order for the men to be able to develop some kind of a business so often the business and I just heard about this recently that there were some problems there my father fell in love with my mother immediately when he saw her but because of the money that my grandpa parents didn't want to give that there was a slight problem but then finally they settled they settled down so they got married and left for a few years together there was more to more to the east was very close to the Russian border some my father really it was spending all do a lot a lot of time out there and he was only a guest in our house as far as I can remember he was only coming home may be far south at the and then back during the summer for the city we use those go there and spend the time with him %HESITATION where was the %HESITATION as as C. H. W. A. D. A. near is almost which was a big yeah a bigger town because of all that was similar like a village in the middle of a forest because they use the bite did what state the trees seventh trip enough process them into parquet floors and how far is that what you said that was not the that must've been about seven hours eight hours by train and you went there for the summer that's right to %HESITATION bedroom as we would call it here apartment with a large kitchen I remember and small bathroom this was a nice apartment for a full dose enough for those days those standards he had the business right then and there so what kind of this he had let the business so it's really was makes but that was mostly residential I would say because they were I mean I'm not quite nice apartment buildings my school was not too far away from from there a private Jewish school so I learned that I remember %HESITATION I learned to about the holidays and I learned I guess a little he broke out and Samantha from those days at all but I remember learning about Passover and about to asking the four questions so those things I don't remember yes my family was observed and they were not ultra religious %HESITATION but my my mother did have a kosher home and my grandparents had a kosher home and so I know that every sought to date I remembered that I was invite I was asked to come to dinner to my grandparents and even if my mother my parents didn't go out and then clothes came and picked me up and took me there I was the first grand child so that was a big let's see if this was your your mother's parents sure you're fine just my mother's parents now make of my father's mother was deceased I never remembered her and her name I was named after her and my grandfather on my father's father was ultra orthodox so as we will see on the picture of that slate around he wore a couple times he wore he had been beer it then and it's very interesting which I didn't remember my mother was telling me that he only eight in that when he came to visit us from a storm it's around them he only stayed with us and only eight to my mother's house because my mother was small kosher he taught then his other daughter still lived in the round of all your other grandparents what language they speak well with me if they spoke Polish up amongst themselves I would say they spoke Yiddish and in your house what did they spend my house they spoke Polish but when they didn't want to meet on the stand then they spoke it dish so naturally I learned how to understand because I wanted to know what's going on in my school the languages Polish you say you went to a private Jewish school yes but so I don't think it was religion taught in the school it had to be big because I remember I was learning about the holidays send about %HESITATION about Jewishness so I guess it had to be in was it a coed school girls and boys I don't remember it might have been yeah it probably was in a different world where we went to school with the same type of children and the at and I don't think that my mother let me let me down to go downstairs and play with everybody because you know I was always either with my mother all with a mate though but somebody's so I don't remember if I was playing better now but now Jos children I mean I remember my very good friends were Jewish well as far as my memory girls %HESITATION I don't remember what time because I thought we had breakfast and after that the ten o'clock every morning I went downstairs to my aunt who owned the building and there I have my second breakfast because apparently I was a little chubby girl and I love to eat and after death to be with my mother would probably I would go back up stairs some people to go to a cafe house but my mother and be able to have another piece of Danish because I was not allowed to have any other piece of cake because it wasn't good for me some vanish my mother would spent I guess an hour two hours there and then we will %HESITATION I guess go back home but this was the days when I didn't have school well then I had school then I guess I would be taken walked to school after school I guess I would come home they would bring me back home for dinner because that was the main meal was at two o'clock and then I had to do homework and I guess again I was walked to a friend's house so friend would come to my house and be able to play off they would take me to the park a guess and the for a walk out to play in the park well my mother my father was in the wrong don't really very little because his business a lot of real it ends up father so he spent most of the time there %HESITATION my mother I dialed it because she again had a large family and she was very close with enough but have parents and to have parents had a far as the car business so if you have nothing to DO you would go into day to visit your parents and spend a little time there %HESITATION my father probably from the business point of view %HESITATION probably didn't have to deal our purpose upper middle class I would say yes and were you familiar at all with the Cahill is structure in random drug known I was a little girl and I I all I know that my two cousins so and make a right to to to Israel and I know that %HESITATION they was I in this day and my father help them financially to %HESITATION to leave Poland of which only one west and brought was a friend studying medicine everybody else was home so when we send down around the table though quite a few of us and I remember the holidays either Friday night so sought the date then there is or other holidays and it's interesting because I still remember Passover being celebrated in our house and that remember that at the time was that the youngest one so I asked the four questions and I opened the doors for delays of the lights are still coming off thirty eight and I remember vividly beaver and somehow that at that time that was the summer of thirty eight and all of a sudden I heard people coming to the calling and a lot of commotion docking that that the war might break out and look at that but somehow nobody believed in %HESITATION the team at the slide towards war I don't remember what that was up started crying tremendously somebody from the family that she's leaving double double see her that's at the run and shoot last minute she changed her mind seven made the pollens and was killed where was she going to is going to policy while I am I remember I don't remember the minutes when it broke out but I remember like a day or two days later my father came and said let's leave we are going to some other all the my mother wasn't so crazy about it because she didn't want to leave her family he rented the truck and picked us up and my grand my grandparents gave my mother a big %HESITATION is it cold the that's the case but the back trunk trunk a big chunk of far she should take what Kerr saw willow that's everything gone they and the track and we took a cousin with us who was the daughter of my and from the building and she left with us and I think it was on the third of the fifth of September nineteen thirty nine where we left and %HESITATION I think one of the last ones to leave before %HESITATION random start it was Shelton bompton and that's how our journey start to it took us a few days because we have to stop on the way and I am not here with little girl because of a bombing some Randy and their way of it militaries soldiers and the end of the day but not letting that the private vehicles throw so it took us quite a few days I don't remember exactly how you drove in a truck drove not we have to shift her you had a shelf yeah we were on top of the truck that was like an open dump truck trailer home in all the list on that too because number of when we didn't have five out it means so whatever my mother was selling to it and so that was our income the windows had to be all taped up so they were not the glass was not the shot the rink and the so that that type of %HESITATION we stayed there %HESITATION maybe a few days so the Russians when they already is about the and my father went to the train station I guess to see what's going on and told to feel love field the situation and came home and told my mother let's go to Russia because he's poking met some Russians there and they told him we can get on the train and repair and and go to Russia to leave but my mother would never do that because she didn't want to leave her family nine and she said no way so we stayed there and from there start that I guess we have to leave because of remember that that was switch here that loss but that had to be thirty nine probably be started moving east also state maybe a week to two weeks not as far as my recollection %HESITATION I don't think it was more than that of moving east and we had to leave it is possible that my my my father heart of some things and we know that the would be safer on the date on that the Russians stand on that the Germans what happened to his sawmill when you left nothing he just left it just left it is possible that people would start the telling me but they leave because %HESITATION you know because you might be killed everybody was running away and I guess everybody's feeling was that that the people of the Jews far safer under the Russians stand under the Germans is about to a large community knows of other was a little village failing maybe if you just said but there were three people that aren't that my father was %HESITATION in business with and %HESITATION and it looks could be spent probably we have to spend quite a long time because I remember I went to school in lots and that the it looks the Russians alright I don't remember but it was the middle it was a little town I guess and where did you live there %HESITATION we lived in an apartment both I have realized that well I remember it was I think a one story a one story building and %HESITATION there was some Russian people that rented the apartment to us and I yeah I went to school there and they're already I had Ukrainian friends some Polish friends and all kinds of friends I remember that behind our apartment there was this was a hilly town I guess at that mountain somewhat of an abuse of sleigh ride and they're now four year %HESITATION so we had a normal life my father was working there because so I guess it was experience and the %HESITATION in the mail so he did get the job and %HESITATION and then uncle of one of my uncles ran away from %HESITATION from the around them and some help put up with this and he was saying he was with us too and %HESITATION and this was and I don't remember it might have been nineteen for the day that'll still before that the outbreak of the Russian German war and a one day %HESITATION somebody at the Russian people do crazy people that they lived with my parents off that the Russians are coming %HESITATION and the day out is taking all the refugees and sending them to say be area and my parents now this I was told I don't remember but this incident but they jumped on the windows and they hit in the back of the %HESITATION building in a year like %HESITATION %HESITATION what do you call it when the horses so is in a stable and they they they left the two of us me and my sister the left home so the Russians really came in there I didn't know the Russians and that time yet because it would have been shocked right then and there %HESITATION but they told him they were not going to give the children the way they should come back and %HESITATION and take the whole family but she's she wasn't given to children so they they last and after the death of my cousin also that we took with us from around them was with us up to that point now she told me later around that from then on she left because she came back and she didn't find us so apparently right after my my parents came back they found out about that we have to pack and leave because they were afraid that to my parents were going to be %HESITATION we are going to be taken which maybe would have been better maybe my father would have left if they took us to Siberia but who knows from there %HESITATION we went to a little town name Livvie put it's spelled L. U. D. W. I. P. O. L. and was it East West was is everything was everything now in case we might have been in some little towns all along the way but they really can not to call I remember that I used to be in orphanages love not maybe not orphanages but in the end like day care center and I remember laying on the couch in the afternoon is sleeping and I said well I'm going to write the book one day if I survive but everything just out I can I can I can recall these days I mean I just remember very slight moments and whatever but not the whole story anyhow Ventolin V. Parlin again it was a little town %HESITATION my father got a job there my uncle arms find out with us another uncle caught up with us my my mother is also younger brother my mother was the oldest and he was really at the bit he wasn't in the car business with my grandfather so he started to really selling business until some selling gumbo going from town to town and trying to make some living my father got the job there again and I went to school there again so I really had like two years of fashion schooling and I remember it was my birthday on the nineteenth of June and tell my mother made me a big birthday party and I had lots of smooth it training in France some Polish friends or whatever because by then life had changed and the next day I walk up and everybody started saying the war the war broke out twentieth of June nineteen forty one quite a change I take yeah
